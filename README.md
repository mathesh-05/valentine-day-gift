# 💝 Valentine's Day Proposal Prank App

Demo: https://my-valentine-day-gift.netflify.app/

A fun, interactive React application designed to prank your special someone on Valentine's Day! 

## ✨ Features

- **Playful "Yes" Button**: The "Yes" button is elusive! It moves away when hovered and changes its text to tease the user ("Please No 🥰", "think again 😃").
- **The "No" Button Twist**: Clicking "No" is actually the way to proceed... but wait for the surprise!
- **April Fool Prank**: Instead of a romantic acceptance, the user is greeted with an "April Fool" message and a funny video.
- **Visual Effects**: 
  - Floating hearts background animation.
  - Continuous confetti celebration on the success screen.
  - Glassmorphism card design.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile (though chasing the button is more fun with a mouse!).
